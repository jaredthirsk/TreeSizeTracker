# TreeSizeTracker

So your disk filled up, but which part of your disk?  This app takes snapshots and gives you diff reports so you can know.

# Instructions for Use

## Overview 

Scan a partition.
Later on, scan it again and look at the .txt or .csv report to see deltas.

## Advanced settings

You can choose which directories to roll up into one summary, if you don't care about its potentially massive subdirectory tree.  This helps clean up the report greatly.

# Status

Early prototype, needs UI and usability work, but works.

# Development notes

This was my first vibe coding experiment with Claude Code.  I changed a line of code or two, but I think it got reverted anyway, so the initial functionality is all made by a bot.
